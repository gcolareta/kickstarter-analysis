# Kickstarter Challenge 1

## Overview of Project

The following project is an analysis of crowdfunding campaigns data to uncover trends on their performance.    

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to compare how different crowdfunding campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

1. Data from 1,369 *Theater* crowdfunding campaigns, from the years 2009 through 2017, was analyzed.
2. Campaigns launched in May had the highest rate of success. Out of the 166 campaigns launched, 67% of them were successful, 31% failed and 2% were canceled. 
3. Campaigns launched in June recorded similar numbers to the ones in May. Out of the 153 campaigns launched, 65% were successful, 32% failed and 3% were canceled.


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

1. Data from 976 Plays crowdfunding campaigns is being shown on the  graph above.
2. Most successful campaigns had a goal of less than $10,000.
3. All of the 93 campaigns


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Inconsistencies were found in the *Theater campaigns Outcomes based on Launch Date* data.
- There is no data recorded in 2009.
- The number of theater campaigns launched between 2009 and 2013, is considerably lower compared to campaigns launched on 2014 through 2016.
- There is very little data recorded in 2017. A total of 31 campaigns between January and February only.
- 96% of the data collected is concentrated within the years 2014 and 2016.
- It is unclear why there is little data before the year 2014 and in 2017. It is possible that crowdfunding campaigns for theater became popular in the year 2014 and that their popularity is decreasing in 2017. However, more information is needed to better understand the inconsistencies in the data set.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
