1. Data from 1,369 Theater crowdfunding campaigns has been collected from 2009 through 2017, as shown on the graph above.
2. There is no data recorded in 2009.
3. The number of theater campaigns launched between 2009 and 2013, is considerably lower compared to campaigns launched on 2014 through 2016.
4. There is very little data recorded in 2017. A total of 31 campaigns between January and February only. 
5. Campaigns launched in May had the highest rate of success. Out of the 166 campaigns launched, 67% of them were successful, 31% failed and 2% were canceled. 
6. Campaigns launched in June recorded similar numbers to the ones in May. Out of the 153 campaigns launched, 65% were successful, 32% failed and 3% were canceled.
